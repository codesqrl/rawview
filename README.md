# rawview

A simple SDL-based raw data visualizer.

Usage: ./rawview \<filename\> [w] [h]

where \<filename\> is any readable, seekable file.

The arrow keys will "nudge" the view by one pixel in the corresponding direction.

You can also drag around with the mouse and use the wheel to scroll by 50 lines at a time.

PgUp/Dn will scroll up/down by one screenful at a time.
